# What's the problem?
Part of the World Health Organization's guidance on limiting gut related diseases is to practice healthy eating. As a result, schools in most affected areas are taking precautionary measures by including dietary habits in their curriculum. With middle-aged people at home take less time to focus on their meals, their health is often compromised.


# The idea
The core idea of my project is to solve the given problem statement.
Reducing the ignorance of common people about their digestive health and highlighting the influence of the GIT tract over other systems as well as on the overall health of an individual are the two key issues that I am trying to solve through this project.
This project contains adequate information well illustrated in the form of pictures and animations that provides a basic working knowledge of the entire digestive tract , their disorders and various precautions that can be taken.
The project's purpose and basic functionality is successfully mapped to the problem statement.

# The architecture
Video transcription/translation app

The user navigates to the site and uploads a video file.
Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.
